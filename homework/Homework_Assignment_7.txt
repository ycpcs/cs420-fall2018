1) A certain computer provides its users with a virtual-memory space of 2^32 bytes. 
The computer has 2^18 bytes of physical memory. The virtual memory is implemented by 
paging, and the page size is 4096 bytes. A user process generates the virtual address 
11123456. Explain how the system establishes the corresponding physical location. 



2) When a page fault occurs, the process requesting the page must block while waiting 
for the page to be brought from disk into physical memory. Assume there exists a process 
with five user-level threads where the mapping of user threads to kernel threads is 
many-to-one. If one user thread incurs a page fault while accessing its stack, would the 
other user threads belonging to the same process also be affected by the page fault 
(i.e., would they also have to wait for the faulting page to be brought into memory?) 
Explain.



3) The table below is a page table for a system with 12-bit virtual and physical addresses 
with 256-byte pages. The list of free page frames is D, E, F (that is, D is at the head 
of the list, E is second, and F is last.)

  +-------+------------+
  | Page  | Page Frame |
  +-------+------------+
  |  0    |     -      |
  |  1    |     2      |
  |  2    |     C      |
  |  3    |     A      |
  |  4    |     -      |
  |  5    |     4      |
  |  6    |     3      |
  |  7    |     -      |
  |  8    |     B      |
  |  9    |     0      |
  +-------+------------+

Given the following virtual addresses, convert them to their equivalent physical addresses 
in hexadecimal. All numbers are given in hexadecimal. (A dash for a page frame indicates 
the page is not in memory.)

    a) 9EF
    b) 111
    c) 700
    d) 0FF



4) Consider the following page reference string:

     1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6

How many page faults would occur for the following replacement algorithms, 
assuming one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven frames?  Remember all frames 
are initially empty, so your first unique pages will all cost one fault each.

    a) LRU replacement
    b) FIFO replacement
    c) Optimal replacement
